# Health Insurance Coverage Change, Medicare Hospital Spending and their correlations with Potentially Preventable Deaths Among the Five Leading Causes of Death — United States, 2010 to 2016

# Dataset:
1.	Medicare Hospital Spending by Claim from Data.gov
2.	Health Insurance Coverage rates before and after the Affordable Care Act from kaggle.com
3.  NCHS - Potentially Excess Deaths from the Five Leading Causes of Death from data.gov

# General Question:

1.If the change in percentage covered per state and nationally had a demonstrable effect on cost per beneficiary in that state and nationally.

2. Did those states which have the high Medicare hospital spending also have the high Medicare Enrollment in 2016?

# More Specific Question:
1.Did the expansion of Medicaid coverage in this state create a statistically significant difference between states that expanded coverage and those that did not.

# Purpose:
The PPACA was supposed to flatten the cost curve by extending coverage and providing cost control measures.  This should be presentable by the analysis of Medicare costs per Beneficiary due to it relation of cost per episode.

# Introduction:
#The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or nicknamed Obamacare, is signed into law by President Barak Obama on March 23, 2010. The ACA's major provisions came into force in 2014. 

#We will look at the expansion of Healthcare coverage across the 50 states over the period of 2010 to 2016 and cross reference it with the Medicare Expenditures per Beneficiary over the same time and Span.

#The five leading causes of death in the United States are heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, and unintentional injuries. Together they accounted for 63 percent of all U.S. deaths in 2010, with rates for each cause varying greatly from state to state. *[ ]

#We assume that the death rate in states declined as more people gained health insurance. We will analysis the relationship between death rate change in 51 states and all kinds of health insurance enrollment coverage change from 2010 to 2015.

#We will analysis the correlation between the Medicare Expenditures per Beneficiary and death rate change in each state. 

# Conclusion:
Since 2010 to 2016 , more uninsured people have gained health insurance coverage. Over that period, the uninsured rate dropped from 15.5 percent to 9.4 percent , a 40% reduction in the uninsured rate. 
Those states that expanded Medicaid had an average uninsured rate change with a drop of 5.86 percentage points. while those that did not expand Medicaid had an average uninsured rate change with a drop of 4.72 percentage points.  
Potentially preventable deaths declined during 2010–2015 for three of the five leading causes of death: diseases of the heart, cancer, and stroke. No change was observed for potentially preventable deaths from CLRD. Potentially preventable deaths from unin­tentional injuries increased each year from 2010 to 2015.
The mortality rate in 50 states declined substantially in the five years after the states increased their health care (including the Affordable Care marketplace health insurance) coverage.
