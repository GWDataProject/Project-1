# We are going to look at the expansion of Healthcare coverage across the 50 states over the period of 2010 to 2016 and cross reference it with the change in Medicare Expenditures per Beneficiary over the same time and Span.

General Question:
1.If the change in percentage covered per state and nationally had a demonstrable effect on cost per beneficiary in that state and nationally.
2. Did those states which have the high Medicare hospital spending also have the high Medicare Enrollment in 2016?

More Specific Question:
1.Did the expansion of Medicaid coverage in this state create a statistically significant difference between states that expanded coverage and those that did not.

Purpose:
The PPACA was supposed to flatten the cost curve by extending coverage and providing cost control measures.  This should be presentable by the analysis of Medicare costs per Beneficiary due to it relation of cost per episode.

Dataset:
1.	Medicare Hospital Spending by Claim from Data.govlth Insurance Coveragverage 
2.	Health Insurance Coverage rates before and after the Affordable Care Act from kaggle.com
